# Keyboard Layout Optimization for ALS Patients

This competition is organized together with the [DSSG Summit 2020](www.summit.dssg.pt). Its goal is to optimize a keyboard layout to minimize the workload for usage by an ALS patient. This was motivated by [Anthony Carbajal](www.anthonycarbajal.com), a full-time daily life hacker that aims to find innovative ways to improve his and other ALS-patient lives, with whom we worked together for developing a first version of this solution. You will work in creating innovative solutions to the problem we tried to solve!
